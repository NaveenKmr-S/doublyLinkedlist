# doublyLinkedlist
Algorithm : 

Circular doubly Linked List:
	1.Each node must contain prev and next pointers
	2.when insertion we need to update the values of the prev pointer of new node and next pointer of other node depending upon the usecase , where the node should be added.
	3.Insertion can be done at beggining or in certain position or at the end.
